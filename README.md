# Eye Disease Detection using Deep Learning

## Overview

Eye diseases pose a significant health concern worldwide, impacting millions of individuals. Early identification and treatment are crucial to prevent vision loss and blindness. However, manual diagnosis from medical photographs is time-consuming and challenging, even for experts. Deep learning offers a promising solution by revolutionizing eye disorder detection and diagnosis. In this project, we explore the use of deep learning models to accurately diagnose eye illnesses from fundus images and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Our goal is to achieve earlier detection and improved patient outcomes.

## Challenges

1. **Data Scarcity**:
   - Deep learning models require substantial, diverse datasets for effective generalization.
   - The scarcity of freely accessible eye illness images poses a challenge.
   - Addressing this scarcity is essential for training robust models.

2. **Variation in Eye Disease Images**:
   - Eye disease photographs exhibit variations in clarity, resolution, and contrast.
   - These variations can impact model performance.
   - Robust models must handle diverse image qualities.

3. **Choosing the Right Model**:
   - Model selection, configurations, and architecture significantly affect performance.
   - Optimal choices lead to better efficiency, accuracy, and faster processing.
   - We explore various deep learning architectures to find the most suitable one.

4. **Interpretable Models**:
   - Physicians need to understand why a model makes specific predictions.
   - Interpretable models build confidence and ensure safe clinical usage.
   - We emphasize model transparency and explainability.
